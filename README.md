# What is [pry-rails](https://github.com/rweng/pry-rails)?

It's an amazing replacement for bland 'ol IRB.

# What is [awesome_print](https://github.com/michaeldv/awesome_print)?

It's a pretty printer that makes object your print in your repl look nice.

# What is [quiet_assets](https://github.com/evrone/quiet_assets)?

It's log silencer that saves you from having to look at the same 20 get requests for your assets on each page load in development.
